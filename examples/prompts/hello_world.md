Create a file called `hello.py` that prints "hello world" to stdout.

Requirements:
- The file should contain a simple Python script
- When run with `python hello.py`, it outputs exactly: `hello world` (followed by newline)
- No extra output, no imports needed

When complete, commit your changes:
- Use conventional commit format: `feat: add hello world script`
- Add `outcome: success` in the commit message footer (separated by blank line)
- Use exactly ONE commit for all changes

Example commit message format:
```
feat: add hello world script

Created hello.py that prints hello world.

outcome: success
```
