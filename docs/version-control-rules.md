# Version Control Rules

For inclusion in project_context.md.

## Development Workflow Rules

**Version Control:**
- Planning workflows (PRD, architecture, epics): commit at workflow completion
- Dev workflow (dev-story): commit after each step
- Commit messages: `docs:` prefix for planning artifacts, conventional commits for code
- Keep docs on main, no branch ceremony for planning
- Amend only for typos, new commit for substantive changes
- **Agents never push.** Human reviews and pushes.

**Branch Naming:**
- N/A for solo project (work on main)
